# 😢 Crying 2023 – A Personal Data Story

This is a very personal project — a full-year log of my own crying episodes during 2023.

I tracked when, where, and why I cried, and turned that raw emotional record into something visual, analyzable, and surprisingly insightful.

Beyond its vulnerability, this project is a reminder of how **data isn’t just for business decisions or machine learning models** — it can also help us understand our inner lives, emotional patterns, and even our sense of humor about ourselves.

## 🧠 Why I Did This

I believe data can be a tool for **self-awareness and emotional intelligence**.  
So I asked myself:

- Do I cry more alone or in public?  
- Are there specific months or places where I cry more?  
- Which emotions or triggers show up the most?  
- Am I really that dramatic in airports? *(spoiler: yes)*  
- Can I spot patterns I might want to work on? *(spoiler: also yes)*

## 📊 What’s Inside

- **A breakdown by month** 
- **Top 3 crying locations**
- **Most frequent reasons**
- **Cycle-based tracking**   
- **Public vs. private crying**  
- **Geography of my tears**

## 📝 A Note on Tone

This isn’t about glorifying sadness. It’s about **being honest, curious, and a little bit playful** with data that’s usually invisible.

It’s also about realizing where things might need attention — and where, actually, **there’s nothing to fix at all**.
